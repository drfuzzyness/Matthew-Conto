          <p>This game would have been so much easier to make if we had set our sights much lower. From learning adapting to a new form of game control to learning an undocumented Unity plugin to me learning Unity for the first time, there was a lot to do over little more than a month. </p>
          <p>To start, I had never coded in Unity before. Once I got started, I was able to figure out how to use it, but getting there took a while. Perhaps if I had spent time during the prototyping phase to create a game in Unity, I might have been better prepared.</p>
          <p>Next, we had moderate organizational issues. Getting code between Oliver and I was a bit more difficult than it should have been. At the start, we couldn’t use Github because I didn’t realize that you needed to keep Git from syncing the Library and Temp folders in Unity. Dropbox and Google Drive each posed strange limitations. Eventually we developed in isolation and occasionally merged our code by just passing script and scene files between ourselves. For the future, Github is probably still the best idea, but it would have gone so much better if we had realized how to actually use Git effectively.</p>
          <p>Finally, Oliver and I didn’t have a completely firm idea of what game we would build. I can only really speak to what I thought the goal was but initially I thought the game would be a sort of ‘rock paper scissors’ of pushing, slashing, and blocking in a giant robot. Through technical limitations in what we knew how to implement it scaled father and farther back to 3rd person shooter based around dismemberment and finding lost limbs, to eventually a basic 3rd person shooter using Kinect controls. A strong project goal would have done wonders for focusing on creating an actual game, rather than exploring a strange Kinect plugin.</p>
          <p>And yet, I’m kinda proud of what we ended up making. Much of my work that went into the final build lived in the menu screens and I’m pretty proud of how they turned out. I don’t see AGRB (Awkward Giant Robot Battles) turning into a commercial release given how niche Kinect games are, but it could make a nice arcade cabinet style game.</p>
