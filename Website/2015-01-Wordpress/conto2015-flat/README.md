I'm making my own website, dammit.
=======

I'm tired of dealing with other people's visions of blogs, of websites, and of ghost buttons *(2015)*. So, I'm building a flatfile website before I turn it into *likely* a Wordpress theme.
##Get It Running
To get it up and running, ensure you have **NodeJS** and **Ruby** on your machine, as well as **bower**. Basically, just follow along at [http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html)

To get it compiling, run `bundle exec compass watch` from Terminal. I don't know how you Windows kids do things.
